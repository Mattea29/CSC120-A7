- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
For the House class:
    I overloaded the House constructor to include an integer representing the maximum number of people who can live in the House at once. I made it a private int so that other people cannot change it once the house is constructed. I then made an overloaded moveIn() method which takes in the name of the person trying to move in and their grade year -- both strings -- and then checks the current number of residents compared to the maximum number. Based on that result, the person will be added to the house or denied. I made the overload method take in the grade in order to allow the call signature to be different. 

For the Library Class:
